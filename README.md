## Dummy Ecommerce React App

To build and run a project:

1. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) Must be installed (requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed).

2. In the command line, being in the folder with the project, you need to run the command: `$ yarn`.

3. Then, after installing all packages:
  - `$ yarn build` — just to build the project. A public folder will appear in the root of the project, which will contain all the files.
  - `$ yarn dev` — to build the project and run it on your local server.
